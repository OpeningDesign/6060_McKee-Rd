#### Proposal for [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) Architecture & Engineering Services

---
Thank you for the opportunity to submit our proposal for a new restroom renovation at 6060 McKee Rd; Fitchburg, WI 53719

Although a more nuanced list of requirements will undoubtedly unfold as the project evolves, on a high-level, we understand that the project will include the following...

 - Convert an existing room into restrooms
 - open an existing wall for circulation purposes
 - Scope area is roughly 600sf.

## Fee & Workflow Proposal		

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient, ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address NGG's (and their client's) potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All of OpeningDesign's, and their consultants, newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), that is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the project location and the names of the direct or indirect clients involved, are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all of OpeningDesign's, and their consultants, newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation, and clients involved, remains confidential and private.   Per industry norm, the Architect and the Architectâ€™s consultants are deemed the authors and owners of their respective Instruments of Service, and they retain all common law and statutory rights, including copyright.

> - Please note, no matter which approach (A, B, or C) is used above...
> 	-  Any documentation from parties outside this contract, and/or shared with OpeningDesign **prior** to the signing of this contract, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Any prior emails, or any emails between RGH, OpeningDesign, or any other parties during the duration of the project, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Also, we will not make public anything that RGH explicitly indicates should be kept private.

> Please note, these are not **lump sum** fees, but are instead, **not-to-exceed** fees.  If the project costs go down/up, or less/more scope is involved over time, these fee ceilings will adjust relatively. 
> 
> The **Hourly Rates**, called out below, will apply until this not-to-exceed fee is reached.
>
>By using hourly rates and a not-to-exceed fees based on percentages of construction, we have found this to be a win-win for both parties.  The design professionals are given a little more safeguard against potential [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and the client can realize more economical fees if they are able to make decisions quicker and more consistently--moving the design of the project along quicker.  In addition, clients are able to adjust, on the fly, what types of services they might or might not need as the project unfolds.

### The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

For your reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing design fees in the construction/architecture industry.

[A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).


We are confident that through our unique and open way of working and our strong band of collaborators and consultants, that that we will meet and exceed the industry standard of care.
